### mapObject

Maps the values of an array to an object using a function, where the key-value pairs consist of the original value as the key and the mapped value.

Use an anonymous inner function scope to declare an undefined memory space, using closures to store a return value. Use a new `Array` to store the array with a map of the function over its data set and a comma operator to return a second step, without needing to move from one context to another (due to closures and order of operations).

```js
const mapObject = (arr, func) => arr.map(func).reduce((a, v, i) => ((a[arr[i]] = v), a), {})
```

```js
const squareIt = arr => mapObject(arr, a => a * a);
squareIt([1, 2, 3]); // { 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9 }
```
